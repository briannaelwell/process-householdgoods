							<h2>Call to Action</h2>
							<p>The primary CTA for Household Goods is “Get Involved“. Donations and volunteers are two of the primary resources the organization is continually seeking. For simplicity, I decided to make a button that would include both of these actions, rather than one for donations and another for volunteers. The button’s contrast with the background will allow it to grab the user’s attention. When clicked, the button will lead to a page for those wishing to volunteer or donate.</p>
							<center><img src="images/buttons-01.jpg" alt="button" width="30%" ></center>
							<p></p>
							<p>The secondary CTA is "Receive Goods". Household Goods aims to
								provide furniture and household items to individuals who cannot afford
								them, and this button would assist in accomplishing that goal. When
								clicked, the button will lead to a page where individuals can begin the
								process of requesting goods.</p>

								<p>The style tile below includes an example of the location of these buttons on a sample homepage.</p>

							<h2>Style Tile</h2>
							<p>I created a style tile to show the general feeling for the redesigned website. I began by selecting adjectives that described Household Goods: <strong>warm</strong>, <strong>inviting</strong>, <strong>professional</strong>, <strong>accessible</strong>, and <strong>reliable</strong>. All of my design decisions were made with these descriptors and my research in mind.
							<img src="images/elwell_styletile_revised.jpg" alt="style tile" width="100%">To create a color palette, I drew from the original Household Goods colors and muted them. I wanted the new site to feel warm, yet neutral and not overwhelming. I chose warm-toned imagery to convey a sense of comfort and home.</p>
							<p>I redesigned the Household Goods logo, simplifying and modernizing it. Bely Display is the typeface I chose for the logo, as well as for the main headers. The rest of the type is Futura, in either the light, medium, or book weights. I also created some possible buttons for the site.</p>
