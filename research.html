							<h2>Primary Client Research</h2>
							<h3>About Household Goods</h3>
							<p>Household Goods is a Massachusetts-based nonprofit with the mission of providing furniture and household items to individuals who cannot afford them. The organization was founded in 1990 by Ira and Barbara Smith. Over the years, Household Goods outgrew the couple's backyard to a 10,000 square foot home at 530 Main Street in Acton, Masschusetts. Here, individuals can both donate goods and recieve donations. Many of the people who need Household Goods are recently homeless, veterans, survivors of domestic violence, low income, immigrants, victims of disaster, or are coping with illness or disability. Every year, volunteers spend over 40,000 hours of their time, working with over 300 social service agencies to help 2,500 families throughout eastern and central Massachusetts make a home.</p>

							<h3>Current Site</h3>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/research1.jpg" alt="homepage" /></span>
							<p>The main issue I found with the Household Goods Site (which can be found <a href="https://householdgoods.org/">here</a>) is the system of organizing information. There is a lot of important information on the site, but it needs to be better organized. The website has an overwhelming amount of text, especially on the homepage, so it is pretty difficult to understand where to navigate next; all of the content needs to be simplified and better organized.</p>
						
							<p>The website has the following main sections in the menu bar:</p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/research2.png" alt="capital" /></span>
								<ul>
									<li>Home</li>
									<li>Donate</li>
									<li>Volunteer</li>
									<li>Recieve</li>
									<li>About</li>
									<li>Contact</li>
									<li>Capital Campain</li>
								</ul>

							<h4>Home</h4>
							<p>The homepage includes importart COVD-19 information, a video, and links to donate goods or funds, as well as a place to sign up to volunteer. There is also information about the organization, as well as links to the 2019 Annual Report, Agency Referrals, a Volunteer Login, and Holiday Closures.</p>

							<h4>Donate</h4>
							<p>The Donate tab includes a place to donate goods, funds, or a vehicle. There is also a space for online donations and to donate to the Capital Campaign.</p>

							<p>The nonprofit has a section on their website dedicated to the Captial Campaign, which will add onto and improve their exisiting facility. This page includes information and ways to contribute to the campaign.</p>

							<h3>Current Branding</h3> 
							<span class="image right"><img src="images/insta2.png" alt="logo" /></span>

							<span class="image right"><img src="images/logo.jpg" alt="logo" /></span>

								<p>Household Goods has established branding for themselves as an organzation. On the right is their current logo and slogan, <i>"Helping People Make A Home."</i> The nonprofit currently uses orange, yellow, green, and sometimes purple in all of their branding.</p>
								<p>They also have an instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/household_goods_acton/">@household_goods_acton</a>. It is not a super active account, but it is used sometimes. When graphics are posted on the instagram, they align with the established brand colors, as pictured on the right of the logo.</p>

								<h2>Secondary Research</h2>
							</header>
							<p>For secondary research, I looked at data, some organizations similar to Household Goods, and recent innovations in the world of furniture donation services.</p>

							<h3>Data</h3>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Nine million tons of furniture go to landfills every year.</li>
									<li>In 2018 an estimated 20,068 people were experiencing homelessness in Massachusetts, representing a 20.6 percent increase compared to 2010.</li>
									<li>Nationally, there are 553,000 homeless people in the United States on a given night, or 0.17% of the population.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<h3>Similar Organizations</h3>
							<span class="image right"><img src="images/research3.jpg" alt="logo" /></span>
							<h4>GreenDrop</h4>
							<p>GreenDrop has been selected by the American Red Cross, the Military Order of the Purple Heart, the National Federation of the Blind and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul of Philadelphia, to raise funds through the generation and collection of donated clothing and household items. Donated items are converted into critical dollars for these organizations, to assist them in upholding their mission and programs for supporting American veterans, the nation’s blind and neighbors in need throughout Philadelphia. Their website is <a href="https://www.gogreendrop.com/">here</a>.
							</p>

							<h4>Americans for Indepedent Living & Furniture for Veterans</h4>
							
							<p>AFIL (Americans for Indepedent Living) and their partner agencies are providing safe, clean living spaces to veterans experiencing homelessness however, the units are typically unfurnished, leaving these Veterans to sleep on the floor, no means to cook, sit, or enjoy the basic comforts of a furnished home. It is this gap we are closing with the support of furniture and household items within the community. Furniture for Veterans was established to fill this void. Since the start of this program, AFIL has provided and delivered over $25,000 in donated furniture and items to veterans who were previously experiencing homelessness.

							<h3>News & Innovations</h3>
							<h4>Green Standards</h4>
							<p>Green Standards is trying to combat the amount furniture that goes into landfills. Read more about it <a href="https://greenstandardsltd.com/">here</a>. They are sustainably managing the resale, recycling, and donation of office furniture and equipment. Their site is a helful point of reference for me as I redsign the Household Goods site.</p>

							<h4>Amazon</h4>
							<p>Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) Donations, is a new program beginning on September 1, 2019, that will donate eligible new and returned stock from third-party sellers in the US and UK to charity. It will work with charity partners and manage the logistics to make it easy for its independent sellers according to the company. The donation option will be the default option for all the company's sellers when they decide to get rid of unsold and wanted products in Amazon warehouses. Sellers will have the option to opt out of the program. Read more in <a href="https://www.goodnet.org/articles/amazon-will-help-sellers-donate-unsold-unwanted-inventory">this</a> article.</p>

							<h2>Interviews</h2>
							<p>Following my research, I conducted interviews. I was unable to schedule an interview with my client, however I was able to sit down and talk to three potential audience members.</p>
							<h3>Interview One</h3>
							<p>I first interviewed Phyllis and Hemerde Thomas, former missionaries who worked closely with non-profits to receive goods during their time on the mission field. The organization would accept donations of furniture, clothes, food, or any other items and would distribute them to those of the most need. Mr. and Mrs. Thomas provided a lot of valuable insight on the behind-the-scenes operations of these organizations.</p>
							<p>Two of the main things I took away from our conversation were the importance of both transparency and community in organizations such as these. One technique that facilitated donations (whether goods or monetary) was showing people the work that was being done. This encouraged individuals to donate, because they could clearly see where their money would be going. Additionally, once people got involved and connected, they started to become more invested. In regards to my website, I plan to highlight success stories and/or have a place for volunteers to connect with each other.</p>
							<h3>Interview Two</h3>
							<p>My second interview was with Trudie Elwell, my mother. I interviewed her because she could be a potential audience member for the site—either as a volunteer or as someone who would donate goods. As a possible user, I asked about her impression of the usability of the current Household Goods website; she stated that it was confusing to navigate. Because of the amount of text, it was overall hard to understand. She remarked on how effective of a slogan "helping people make a home" was but said that it wasn't effectively communicated. Her suggestions were to incorporate warmer colors and inviting imagery to make the slogan come across more clearly. I will definitely take these observations and recommendations into account when redesigning the site.</p>
